In the 28 October 1980 Carter-Reagan presidential debate, Ronald Reagan said of his proposals for
cutting US federal spending and taxes: 'We have a program for a gradual reduction of Government
spending based on these theories, and I have a task force now that has been working on where those cuts
could be made. I'm confident that it can be done and that it will reduce inflation because I did it in
California. And inflation went down below the national average in California when we returned the
money to the people and reduced Government spending' (Commission on Presidential Debates, 1980).</mixed-citation>

Slemrod (1992) makes a somewhat different distinction along these Unes, separating 'real' responses
on one hand from accounting and financial responses on the other. But the key point in each instance is
to draw a line between responses that require a significant change in economic activity and those that do
not. A second distinction may involve government intent, in that governments seeking to induce
substantive changes in economic activity may instead elicit changes in the characterisation of existing
activities.</mixed-citation>

Hybrid entities grew out of the so-called 'check-the-box' regulations adopted by the US in 1997.
Under these regulations, originally designed to simplify tax filing for certain domestic entities, US parent
corporations can treat subsidiaries in high-tax jurisdictions as branches of subsidiaries in low-tax
jurisdictions even though such subsidiaries may be viewed as distinct by the high-tax jurisdiction. The
result is that payments that are tax deductible in the high-tax jurisdiction are not immediately taxable by
the US, contrary to their treatment had the entities been viewed as distinct. See Altshuler and Grubert
(2005) for further discussion.</mixed-citation>

Auerbach (2006b) attributes nearly three-quarters of the taxes collected from US non-financial
corporations during the period 2001-03 to the asymmetric treatment of gains and losses. That is, holding
behaviour fixed and eliminating asymmetries would have reduced revenues from non-financial
corporations during the period by about three-quarters. By comparison, the average share of taxes
attributable to losses over the period 1983-98 was a quarter.</mixed-citation>

Such an approach was proposed by Bradford (1998). It is closely related to the Allowance for
Corporate Equity (ACE) approach analysed by Boadway and Bruce (1984) and Bond and Devereux
(1995), which would provide a deduction for the normal rate of return on equity rather than on all
corporate capital while maintaining existing treatment of debt-financed investments.</mixed-citation>

Arguing that the proposed system was economically equivalent to a VAT plus other taxes and
subsidies, the report (President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, 2005, p. 171) indicated a belief
that the system 'should be border adjustable'. But it is not clear that this belief is well founded in law.</mixed-citation>

In reality, one cannot cleanly distinguish intended from unintended bequests because most bequests
will reflect both motivations: individuals may derive some satisfaction from leaving estates to heirs even
if the estates are larger than they would be in the case of perfect annuity markets. But the underlying
point is the same - that the increase in bequests attributable to the lack of perfect annuity markets makes
the estate tax less distortionary. Taking this factor into account, Kopczuk (2003) estimates that the estate
tax may be just as efficient as the general income tax, a noteworthy finding given that estate tax
payments are so highly concentrated among the wealthy.</mixed-citation>
