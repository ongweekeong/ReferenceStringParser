         <abstract>
            <p>Little is known about private student loan discrimination, in contrast to the relatively developed research on discrimination in other credit markets such as mortgages and credit cards. The private student lending market can play a key role in responding to changes in the policy or economic environment, and many students and their families turn to the private loan market in order to cover financial need that is unmet by publicly funded programs. This paper includes a review of strategies used to measure discrimination in other credit contexts and a consideration of the applicability of such techniques for use in testing for differential outcomes in the private student loan market. The aim of the paper is to connect extant credit market discrimination literature and models to private student loans and to suggest possible avenues for future inquiry into the topic. Although fair lending analyses from other contexts provide lessons for measuring discrimination in educational credit markets, there is a need for better data and a more developed understanding of decision making in educational credit markets.</p>

Regulatory changes in 2010 eliminated FFELP, such that most federal student loan programs
have since only been available directly from the government. Its worth noting, however, that there are
threats to the political viability of the government as the only provider of federal educational credit.
For example, the Republican platform in the 2012 election cycle (available at www.gop.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/08/2012GOPPlatform.pdf) voiced strong support for increasing private lender
participation in educational credit markets, allowing the possibility that we may see a return of private
lenders to a role as a principal student loan provider in the future.</mixed-citation>

For ease of discussion purposes in this paper, protected classes are discussed in the context of
members of minority races and ethnicities, with non-Hispanic white ("NHW") borrowers as the
comparator group. Discussion could be extended to discrimination based on other protected classes,
such as by sex or religion.</mixed-citation>

There are other remedies available to some private student lenders dating back to 1985. Originators
of federally guaranteed student loans have further creditor protections beyond just nondischargeability;
failure to repay federal student loans can result in wage garnishment, having tax refunds seized to pay
for outstanding balances, and other penalties.</mixed-citation>

Because APR is typically not negative, a risk with using OLS is that estimates could be biased or
create out-of-range predictions. Nonetheless, OLS is commonly used in analyses of APR, in part because
APRs are rarely close to zero and infrequently take on extreme values. Researchers might consider the
use of other models, such as a Tobit, depending on the distribution of their data.</mixed-citation>

The SCF is a survey of financial activity of households conducted every three years. Data used in the
analysis include three survey waves of data from 2001,2004, and 2007. Race/ethnicity of the borrower is
based on the race/ethnicity of the head of the household. Income and loan amounts are used in constant
2010 dollars based on the Consumer Price Index.</mixed-citation>

Title VIII of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1977, better known as the
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), targets differential provision of credit to communities of
different economic compositions. CRA encourages depository lenders to "meet the credit needs of
their communities" by providing a comparable flow of funds to minority areas as they do to NHW
neighborhoods. Lenders' CRA performance is publicly evaluated regularly, and poor performance on
CRA exams can result in delayed or prevented acquisitions, mergers, new charters, and branch openings.</mixed-citation>

Until 2008, many private lenders offered private loans as an auxiliary to federal loan programs to
cover unfunded costs (CFPB 2012b). The close relationship between many private lenders and some
institutions' financial aid offices led to a number of public investigations and increased regulation as
part of HEOA.</mixed-citation>
