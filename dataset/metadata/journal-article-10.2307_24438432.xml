         <abstract>
            <p>This paper analyses the reported performance of foreign-owned manufacturing subsidiaries in the UK between 1994 and 1998. The paper is set in the context of uncertainty about the performance of some foreign-owned sectors of UK manufacturing and the implications of this performance for the beneficial spillover effects sought by policy-makers from foreign-owned capital. Japanese-owned subsidiaries are the focus of particular attention, with reported profits and tax liabilities significantly below those of subsidiaries from other national sources. The wider ramifications of this finding are analysed for the UK case, particularly in terms of the need to take into account the wider exchequer effects of inward investment in the general evaluation of the financial assistance provided to foreign firms.</p>

An alternative variable is the return on net capital employed (total assets less current liabilities). In this study,
we are interested in the return on total capital. In any event, the return on net capital employed ratio may
misbehave statistically, since the denominator may take negative values. Profit before tax will vary, inter alia,
because of differences in capital expenditure (depreciation) and gearing (interest), but this paper does not aim
to analyse the determinants of these expenses (for example, profit before interest and/or depreciation). In any
event, such measures focus more on liquidity than profit.</mixed-citation>

For example, all companies covered in this paper are required to depreciate fixed assets 'on a systematic basis
over its useful economic life, using a method that reflects as fairly as possible the pattern in which its economic
benefits are consumed' (Davies, Paterson and Wilson, 1999, p. 748).</mixed-citation>

Note that it is not possible to use fixed-effects estimation, since the foreign effects would be dropped as they

For information, the random-effects model with the foreign dummy showed that returns earned by foreign
firms were 3.4 percentage points lower than those for domestic firms; that net profit margin was 2.6 percentage
points lower than in the domestic case; and that tax as a proportion of turnover was 0.54 of a percentage point
lower than in the domestic case. We omit these results for reasons of brevity, but the full set of estimates is
available from the authors upon request.</mixed-citation>

Note that the home-country measure of return on capital employed is not observed at the industry level and so
the standard errors are adjusted to circumvent problems of aggregation bias (Moulton, 1990).</mixed-citation>
