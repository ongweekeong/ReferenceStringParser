         <abstract>
            <p>This study aims to identify underlying fundamental factors behind high-tech exports by the established and emerging countries, separately. The author also examines whether the two export patterns converge over time. Based on the gravity approach, a generalized method of moments panel estimator is applied to rigorously address the endogeneity problem in both static and dynamic versions of the model. In addition, the nonstationary and cointegrating features of variables are discussed. The author finds that high-tech exports from the emerging countries are mainly based on foreign direct investment inflows and participation in the international production chain, as well as a high degree of export concentration, while high-tech exports from the established exporters are mainly linked to industrial infrastructures, research and development, and export diversification. Nevertheless, the two export patterns converge over time.</p>

The most popular criterion to define high-tech goods is the share of research and devel-
opment expenditure relative to the industry's total sale and the ratio of skilled labor to the total
labor force in the industry. Based on the first, Eberth (2008) identified 252 product categories at
the six-digit harmonized system level as high-tech goods. This study follows the same definition
for these goods.</mixed-citation>

Due to the recent world crisis, the data for the periods after 2008 may not reflect reli-

Linder (1961) interprets the inequality between two countries' per capita incomes as
"taste" differences between them. In this case, a higher difference in per capita incomes leads to
lower intraindustry trade between the two countries. On the contrary, the same variable is taken
by Helpman and Krugman (1985) as a measure for the difference in the capital labor endowment
ratio. According to them, higher per capita income differences induce international trade of the
Heckscher-Ohlin type. As a result, a positive coefficient for DGDPP supports the Heckscher-Ohlin
theorem while a negative one is instead in line with the Linder (1961) approach.</mixed-citation>

DISTtJ = CLl;ei(popk/popl)I.ICJ(popllpopl)DISTll)"&lt; where popk designates the population of
urban agglomeration k belonging to country i. The parameter 0 measures the sensitivity of trade
flows to bilateral distance DISTU. This way of calculating bilateral distances has the advantage of
including all the distances between major cities in exporting and importing countries, weighted
by the share of each city in the country's overall population.</mixed-citation>

There are two versions of the dynamic ABB model: difference and system GMM. This study
uses the difference version, which instrumentalizes the endogenous variables by differencing them
and using the generalized method of moments (Verbeek 2004, pp. 353-366). In this approach, the
instruments are chosen from inside the model, that is, the first-differenced variables are used as
their own instruments.</mixed-citation>

The results also remain stable after using the robust covariance matrix to remedy possible
heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation. This is an especially appropriate method when the number
of time periods (fourteen) is small compared to the number of groups (5,940).</mixed-citation>
