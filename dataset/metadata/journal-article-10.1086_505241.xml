            <p>This article develops a model in which optimal capital structure and debt maturity are jointly determined in a stochastic interest rate environment. The model yields leverage ratios that are consistent in spirit with empirical observations. The optimal maturity and credit spread of an optimally issued debt are found to be smaller than observed values. The long‐run mean of the interest rate is found to be a key variable in determining optimal capital structure and debt maturity. Furthermore, the interest rate volatility and the correlation between the interest rate and the firm’s asset value play important roles in determining debt maturity.</p>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>The problem of optimal capital structure has long been an intriguing one among researchers. Brennan and Schwartz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf5">1978</xref>) were perhaps the first to study this problem using the contingent‐claims analysis approach of Black and Scholes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf4">1973</xref>), Merton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf29">1974</xref>), and Black and Cox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf3">1976</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2">1</xref>More recently, Leland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf24">1994</xref>) introduced a model of optimal capital structure based on a perpetuity. Leland and Toft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf26">1996</xref>) extended Leland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf24">1994</xref>) to examine the effect of debt maturity on bond prices, credit spreads, and optimal leverage. The debt maturity in Leland and Toft is assumed rather than optimally determined.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">2</xref>Titman and Tsyplakov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf35">2002</xref>) and Hennessy and Whited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf15">2004</xref>) show that a dynamic trade‐off model with features that are not typically included in previous capital structure models can explain many stylized facts.</p>
         <p>The traditional capital structure models, as represented by Brennan and Schwartz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf5">1978</xref>), Leland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf24">1994</xref>), and others, assume constant risk‐free interest rates. Leland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf24">1994</xref>) and Goldstein et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf13">2001</xref>) show that the optimal capital structure is very sensitive to the changes in the level of the interest rate. In other words, the level of the interest rate is a key input in those models. In the absence of explicit modeling of the interest rate process, however, the traditional capital structure models do not provide any guidance on which interest rate, such as the spot rate, the yield‐to‐maturity (YTM) of a risk‐free bond, or other interest‐related variables, should be used in the determination of the optimal capital structure. Because their results depend critically on the interest rate, without knowing which interest rate to use, the traditional capital structure models cannot be employed directly to explain the empirical observations. Another restrictive assumption that limits the applicability of the traditional models is that debt maturity is exogenously specified. Because the leverage ratio and the credit spread depend crucially on debt maturity, it is of great importance to determine jointly the optimal capital structure and the optimal debt maturity. In the absence of an optimal maturity structure, the optimal capital structure, as obtained in the traditional models, is of limited empirical relevance.</p>
         <p>In this article, we develop a dynamic model in which an optimal capital structure and an optimal debt maturity structure are jointly determined in a stochastic interest environment.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref>At time zero, the firm issues a<italic>T</italic>‐year coupon bond. If the firm has not gone bankrupt in<italic>T</italic>years, the firm issues a new<italic>T</italic>‐year coupon bond at time<italic>T</italic>. The optimal value of the new bond will depend on the firm value at time<italic>T</italic>. If at the end of the second<italic>T</italic>‐year period the firm is still solvent, it issues another<italic>T</italic>‐year coupon bond optimally. This process goes on indefinitely as long as the firm is solvent. The optimally levered firm value at time zero takes into account the tax benefits associated with all future leverages. To obtain the optimally levered firm value, we need to compute explicitly the total tax benefit, the total bankruptcy cost, and the total transactions cost of all future issues of debt. Generally, this is a difficult problem because the issuance of future debt depends on the fact that the firm has not gone bankrupt. We employ a scaling property and a fixed‐point argument to obtain the present values of the total tax benefit, the total bankruptcy cost, and the total transactions cost explicitly. Valuation formulas are derived in closed form, and numerical solutions are used to obtain comparative statics.</p>
         <p>In our model, the trade‐off between tax shields and bankruptcy costs associated with debts yields an optimal capital structure. Firms may issue new debt as firm values change over time. The trade‐off between the gains from dynamically adjusting the debt level and the transactions costs of doing so yields an optimal debt maturity structure. The optimal capital structure and the optimal maturity structure are interdependent. The interest rate is modeled as a Vasicek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf36">1977</xref>) mean‐reverting process. Modeling the interest rate as a mean‐reverting process allows us to examine separately the impact of the long‐run mean and the initial value of the interest rate.</p>
         <p>When the interest rate is assumed to be a constant, the level of the constant interest rate plays an important role in determining the optimal leverage ratio and debt maturity. In our model with stochastic interest rates, however, the optimal leverage ratio and debt maturity are mainly determined by the long‐run mean of the interest rate process. If the initial interest rate is below/above the long‐run mean (an upward‐ or downward‐sloping term structure), the firm optimally adjusts downward/upward the coupon and principal of the debt so that its market value (the present value of the coupon and principal) is independent of the initial interest rate level and is proportional to the prevailing asset value when the debt is issued. Consequently, the optimal leverage ratio and debt maturity are independent of the spot interest rate level. These results are quite different from those in a model with constant interest rates, in which the optimal leverage ratio, debt maturity, coupon rate, and principal all depend on the interest rate level.</p>
         <p>We find that the long‐run mean of the stochastic interest rate process is the most important variable in the determination of the optimal capital structure. This is intuitive because the long‐run mean plays a key role in the determination of the tax shields and bankruptcy costs associated with all future debt issues. The reason is that while at any one point in time there is only one bond outstanding in our model, the capital structure and debt maturity are determined by taking into account all future debt issues, and the best information for the future interest rate is its long‐run mean. Unlike the spot interest rate and a YTM, the long‐run mean of a short‐term interest rate process is not an empirical observable; one must estimate it using historical data as well as a specific model for the interest rate process. Therefore, it is essential to consider a stochastic interest rate process in the determination of a firm’s capital structure.</p>
         <p>The optimal leverage ratio of about 35% obtained from our dynamic model compares favorably with the historical average for a typical large publicly traded firm in the United States. By contrast, most static models typically predict very high leverage ratios.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5">4</xref>
         </p>
         <p>We find that the tax rate and the transactions cost are the two most important parameters in determining the optimal maturity because the optimal maturity is the result of the trade‐off between the transactions cost of and the gain from adjusting the debt level in the future. On the one hand, the firm should issue short‐maturity debt and therefore give itself the opportunity to issue new debt optimally, depending on the firm value when the old debt matures. On the other hand, if new debt is issued too often, transactions costs will become too large. When the firm behaves optimally, in addition to an optimal capital structure, an optimal maturity structure emerges. Consistent with Childs, Mauer, and Ott (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf6">2003</xref>), a higher transaction cost yields a longer debt maturity because it is more costly to rebalance a firm’s capital structure, and thus the firm does so less frequently. By contrast, it is more valuable to recapitalize the firm's capital structure if the corporate tax rate is higher. Therefore, a higher tax rate yields a shorter (optimal) debt maturity. The relationship among the tax rate, transaction cost, and optimal debt maturity is consistent with the predictions in Childs et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf6">2003</xref>). However, the reasons behind the results of transactions cost and tax rate are not the same. Our explanation is the trade‐off between tax benefits and the transactions costs of dynamically adjusting a firm’s capital structure, whereas that in Childs et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf6">2003</xref>) is based on minimizing the agency cost of the second‐best exercising policy of the growth options.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">5</xref>
         </p>
         <p>Another interesting result is that the optimal maturity is inversely related to the asset volatility level. This result is easy to understand in our framework because the flexibility to rebalance capital structure is an option. When the firm’s asset return process is more volatile, the firm would like to issue debt more frequently to capture the tax benefit or reduce the bankruptcy cost. Due to a high volatility, the firm’s asset value may change in greater magnitude. When its asset value goes up, the firm wants to issue more debt to capture the tax benefit. When its asset value goes down, the firm wants to issue less debt to reduce the bankruptcy cost. Consequently, the firm may want to issue debt with shorter maturity so that it can issue debt more frequently in response to the changes in its asset values. Similarly, we find that in addition to the long‐run mean of the interest rate process, the volatility of the interest rate process and the correlation between the interest rate process and the firm’s asset value process play nontrivial roles in the determination of the debt maturity structure.</p>
         <p>The joint determination of the optimal capital structure and the optimal debt maturity leads to results that would not have been obtained in a model in which only the optimal capital structure is determined. For example, when the volatility of the asset return process or the interest rate process increases, one may expect that the credit spread of the firm’s debt increases as well. When the firm can choose its debt maturity, however, it optimally issues debt with shorter maturity so that the credit spread of the firm’s debt may not increase. The reason is that a debt with a shorter maturity has a lower default risk.</p>
         <p>For further comparative statics, we calculate the optimal capital structure while fixing the maturity structure as well as the optimal maturity structure while fixing the capital structure. Some interesting results arise. For example, we find that the firm’s optimal leverage ratio is not a monotone function of the debt maturity. Intuitively, one may believe that when the firm is constrained to issue long‐term debt, the firm may want to issue less debt because of a potentially higher probability of default risk. By contrast, however, if a firm is constrained to issue long‐term debt, it means that the firm cannot issue debt as often as it desires. If a firm cannot issue debt more frequently, then it may want to issue a higher amount per debt to capture the tax benefit. The trade‐off between the firm’s desire to capture the tax benefit and its need to reduce bankruptcy costs leads to a nonmonotone relation between leverage ratio and debt maturity.</p>

            </inline-formula>times of the value of a risk‐free zero‐coupon bond with the same face value.</p>
         <p>We have two comments concerning assumption 6. First, the capital structures in Leland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf24">1994</xref>) and Leland and Toft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf26">1996</xref>) are static in the sense that as the firm’s asset value evolves, the coupon and the face value of the debt remain the same. This is not optimal because the firm may want to change the debt structure when its asset value changes. When the firm rebalances its capital structure, assumption 6 allows the firm to scale up (down) the coupon and the face value if the firm’s asset value has increased (decreased). Given this assumption, we show in<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sc3.3">Section III.C</xref>that the optimal initial debt value at each restructuring point is proportional to the prevailing asset value. For example, if the firm’s asset value has doubled since the previous bond issue, the initial market value of the new bond should be twice that of the previous bond.</p>
         <p>Second, the assumption that debt is issued at the same constant λ times of the price of a risk‐free, zero‐coupon bond with the same face value is a critical one for tractability. However, how the constant λ is chosen is not important for tractability, and different reasonable choices are possible. For example, if we require that the initial debt be priced at par, then we need to set<inline-formula>

            <p>We caution that without explicit solutions we cannot prove that local maximums do not exist, even though this is unlikely. The reason that an optimal capital structure exists is due to the trade‐off between tax shields and the default costs of debt. The marginal tax benefit of debt declines while the marginal default cost of debt increases. Hence, too little or too much debt is unlikely to be optimal, and local maximums are not likely. Similarly, an optimal maturity structure exists because of the trade‐off between the gains of tax shields of dynamically adjusting capital structure and the transaction costs of doing so. Again, adjusting too infrequently or too often is unlikely to be optimal, and local maximums are not likely. In our calculations, we have used wide ranges of<italic>T</italic>and<italic>X</italic>* to locate the optimal (<italic>T</italic>,<italic>X</italic>*).</p>

            <title>Optimal Capital Structure</title>
            <p>
               <xref ref-type="table" rid="tb1">Table 1</xref>reports the comparative statics when the interest rate is constant, and<xref ref-type="table" rid="tb2">table 2</xref>reports the comparative statics when the interest rate is stochastic. Several features are notable.</p>
            <p>First, the long‐run mean α of the interest rate process, rather than the spot interest rate, has the greater impact on firms’ optimal leverage ratios. The reason is that while at any time there is only one finite maturity debt outstanding, the optimal capital structure is based on the total tax shield and total default cost associated with both the existing debt and all future debts. It is the long‐run mean rather than the spot interest rate level that has the greatest impact on the values of these future debts.</p>
            <p>Our calculations indicate that the results with stochastic interest rates are similar to a model with a constant interest rate whose value is calibrated to the long‐run mean of the stochastic interest rate process. Thus, our model provides a justification for the use of constant interest rates in capital structure models, provided that the long‐run mean of the interest rate process instead of the spot interest rate or a YTM is used as the input for the constant interest rate. Without this insight, the traditional capital structure models could not be used to explain empirical findings. Because the long‐run mean is not an empirical observable, one must estimate it using historical data as well as a specific model for the interest rate process. Hence, it is essential to consider a stochastic interest rate process in the determination of the capital structure.</p>
            <p>When the interest rate is assumed to be a constant, its level does have a significant impact on a firm’s capital structure decisions. For example, when the constant interest rate is 5%, the optimal levered firm value, net debt benefit, and the market value of debt (leverage times levered firm value) are $69.5, 6.92%, and $21.11, respectively, whereas the corresponding values are $76.6, 17.85%, and $28.66, respectively, when the constant interest rate is 9%. There are two reasons that the interest rate level is important in a constant interest rate model. First, the usual explanation is that at a higher interest rate, the risk‐neutral drift of the asset value process is higher, and the risk‐neutral default probability becomes lower for the same coupon and principal. Therefore, the firm optimally levers more if the interest rate is higher, 30.37% versus 37.42%, when the constant interest rate is 5% versus 9%. An alternative explanation for this result is that at a higher interest rate, to reduce the impact of more discounting to obtain the present value of tax shields, the firm optimally takes on more debt in earlier periods, resulting in a higher initial leverage ratio.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17">16</xref>
            </p>
            <p>By contrast, when the interest rate is stochastic, the firm makes capital structure decisions based mainly on the long‐run mean of the interest rate process. Given that all debts are issued at<inline-formula>
                  <tex-math notation="LaTeX">\documentclass{aastex} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{bm} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{pifont} \usepackage{stmaryrd} \usepackage{textcomp} \usepackage{portland,xspace} \usepackage{amsmath,amsxtra} \usepackage[OT2,OT1]{fontenc} \newcommand\cyr{ \renewcommand\rmdefault{wncyr} \renewcommand\sfdefault{wncyss} \renewcommand\encodingdefault{OT2} \normalfont \selectfont} \DeclareTextFontCommand{\textcyr}{\cyr} \pagestyle{empty} \DeclareMathSizes{10}{9}{7}{6} \begin{document} \landscape $\lambda =1/ \Lambda ( \alpha ,\, 0;T) $ \end{document}</tex-math>
               </inline-formula>times of the value of a risk‐free, zero‐coupon debt with the same face value (assumption 6), the optimal<italic>X</italic>* is independent of the initial (spot) interest rate level. Consequently, the levered firm value, net debt benefit, and optimal leverage ratio are all independent of the initial interest rate. Furthermore, the initial leverage ratio at each restructuring point is the same, although the prevailing interest rate at each restructuring point is different.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18">17</xref>
            </p>
            <p>As discussed in<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sc3.4">Section III.D</xref>, we note that the optimal coupon and principal of the debt in our model do depend on the initial interest rate level, although the debt value (the present value of the coupon and principal) and initial leverage ratio do not. Thus, the firm’s optimal strategy is to issue debt at each restructuring point whose market value is proportional to the prevailing asset value but independent of the interest rate level. This can be achieved by issuing debt with higher/lower coupon and principal if the interest rate has increased/decreased but by keeping the present value of coupon and principal independent of the interest rate level.</p>
            <p>To examine further how the changes in the term structure affect the capital structure decisions, we fix the initial interest rate at 4% in panel B and 10% in panel C in<xref ref-type="table" rid="tb2">table 2</xref>but change α, β, or σ<sub>
                  <italic>r</italic>
               </sub>of the interest rate process so that the 6‐year risk‐free yield is kept at 7%. The corresponding long‐run means, α, in the last four entries in<xref ref-type="table" rid="tb2">table 2</xref>are 10.28%, 7.16%, 4.15%, and 7.16%, respectively. Thus, relative to the 6‐year, risk‐free yield or the long‐run mean, the two entries in panel B correspond with an upward sloping term structure, and those in panel C correspond with a downward sloping one. The results are consistent with the previous observation that the most important interest rate parameter is the long‐run mean of the interest rate process. For example, the first entry in panel B with a long‐run mean of 10.28% levers more aggressively than the first entry in panel C with a long‐run mean of 4.15%. The reason is that the long‐run mean is more important than the initial interest rate in determining capital structures. A model with constant interest rates would have predicted that the firm would lever more aggressively at 10% than at 4% of the interest rate.</p>
            <p>Second, the leverage ratios obtained from our model (around 35%) compare more favorably with the historical average of about 30% for a typical large publicly traded firm in the United States than the predictions of most static optimal capital structure models. The reason for the lower leverage ratio in our dynamic model is that, in a static model, a firm cannot adjust its debt level in the future and, therefore, issues debt more aggressively. By contrast, a firm with an option to restructure in the future issues debt less aggressively, for it can adjust its capital structure when the firm’s asset value changes.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19">18</xref>Moreover, the cost of default for the firm includes not only the cost of bankruptcy but also the loss of the option value of adjusting the debt level in the future. Hence, default is more costly in the dynamic setting, further decreasing the initial optimal leverage ratio.</p>
            <p>Third, the comparative static results with respect to the correlation coefficient between the interest rate process and the firm’s asset value process in<xref ref-type="table" rid="tb2">table 2</xref>reveal that the correlation coefficient has little impact on a firm’s capital structure decisions. The reason is that the covariance σ<sub>

                  <italic>i</italic>

               </sub>between the asset value return and the interest rate process is much smaller than the typical values of the variance of the asset value returns,<inline-formula>

               </inline-formula>consider the effect of the speed of the mean‐reverting parameter β. Given that the initial interest rate of 7% is close to the long‐run mean of 7.16%, the mean‐reversion parameter β has a small impact on model outputs. The last two rows of panel A in<xref ref-type="table" rid="tb2">table 2</xref>indicate that although the interest rate volatility increases four times from 0.01 to 0.04, the increase in the leverage ratio is quite small. The reason is that the return of the asset value is much more volatile than the interest rate process, and thus the added volatility in the interest rate process has little impact on the first‐passage time to the default boundary.</p>
            <p>In sum, our calculations suggest that the long‐run mean is the most important variable of a stochastic interest rate process in determining the optimal capital structure.</p>

            <title>Optimal Maturity Structure</title>
            <p>The shareholders’ strategic consideration of dynamic adjustments of the debt level yields an optimal maturity structure. The trade‐off in this case is between the transactions costs of issuing debt and the gains from adjusting debt level dynamically. On the one hand, the firm should issue short‐maturity debt and therefore afford itself the opportunity to issue new debt optimally, depending on the firm value when the old debt matures. On the other hand, if new debts are issued too often, transactions costs will become too large. When the firm behaves optimally, in addition to an optimal capital structure, an optimal maturity structure emerges.</p>
            <p>The optimal maturities are reported in column 2 in<xref ref-type="table" rid="tb1">table 1</xref>and in<xref ref-type="table" rid="tb2">table 2</xref>. The tables show that the two most important parameters are the tax rate and the transactions cost because the optimal maturity is the result of the trade‐off between the transactions cost of and the gain from adjusting the debt level in the future.</p>
            <p>Barclay and Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf2">1995</xref>) find that during the period of 1974–92, firms in their sample have 51.7% of their debts due in more than 3 years. Because on average, the debt would have existed for half of its lifetime at any point in time, the median maturity at issue appears to be a little over 6 years. Stohs and Mauer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf33">1996</xref>) find that the median time to maturity is 3.38 years for their sample. Therefore, the mean maturity of all debts at issue appears to be between 6 and 7 years, consistent with Barclay and Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf2">1995</xref>). Most of the optimal maturities in the two tables are between 3 and 4 years, shorter than the empirical values. While our theoretical values are smaller than 6 years, it is to be noted that the optimal maturities in the two tables with a 20% tax rate are close to 6 years. Even though 35% is the top corporate tax rate, the effective corporate tax rate for most firms is likely to be lower due to investment credit, loss‐carry forward, and personal tax effects.</p>
            <p>The comparative static results with respect to the firm’s asset volatility indicate that the optimal debt maturity is inversely related to it.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22">21</xref>This is due to an optionlike effect. The higher the asset volatility, the greater the value of the option to adjust the capital structure in the future. The gains from dynamically adjusting the debt level are reduced if the firm’s asset value is less volatile. In this case the firm recapitalizes its capital structure less frequently. This appears to be consistent with the empirical evidence. For example, in the sample of Barclay and Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf2">1995</xref>), 36.6% of equally weighted debts mature in more than 5 years, but the percentage increases to 45.9% with value‐weighted debts. Therefore, larger firms tend to have longer maturity debts. Because larger and more mature firms are less volatile than smaller and less mature ones, it follows that less volatile firms have longer maturity debts. We also note a similar inverse relation between optimal maturity and the interest rate process volatility, because a higher interest rate volatility implies more variability in the risk‐neural firm asset value process. For example, the optimal maturity is 3.4 years when<inline-formula>

               <xref ref-type="table" rid="tb1">Table 1</xref>and<xref ref-type="table" rid="tb2">table 2</xref>indicate that with our model inputs, when firms are optimally levered, the credit spreads are around 14 basis points. These values are lower than the historical credit spread. Leland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf24">1994</xref>) reports that the average historical credit spread is about 52 basis points after the impact of call provisions is eliminated. There are two main reasons that the credit spreads in our model are small. First, debt maturities in the two tables are generally quite short. Shorter maturity debts normally have lower default risks and thus lower credit spreads. Second, it is well known that structural models like ours generally yield credit spreads that are too small, indicating that factors not considered in a typical contingent‐claim structural model play important roles in determining the credit spread.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23">22</xref>For example, Tang and Yan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf34">2004</xref>) demonstrate that macroeconomic conditions can affect credit spreads significantly. Childs et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf6">2003</xref>), by contrast, show that incorporating agency conflicts between bondholders and shareholders can generate credit spreads that are more consistent with observations.</p>
            <p>While our calculations show that the model predictions of credit spreads are small, comparative static calculations do indicate that the various underlying variables affect the credit spreads in expected ways. For example, with the coupon and principal fixed at their optimal base case values, that is, 1.86 and 25.59, respectively, increasing the debt maturity to 6 years increases the credit spread to 47.27 basis points from 14.15, while it increases to 65.63 basis points if the asset volatility increases to 0.25. When the fraction of the asset value lost to default increases to 0.6, the credit spread increases to 16.87. When the correlation coefficient between the interest rate process and the asset value process increases from 0 to 0.3, the credit spread increases to 19.44.</p>

            <title>Optimal Capital Structure with Fixed Maturity or Optimal Maturity with Fixed Debt Capacity</title>
            <p>So far we have discussed the model implications assuming that the firm optimizes both its capital structure and its debt maturity. With a dynamic framework, our model is flexible enough to allow for the determination of the optimal capital structure with a fixed debt maturity or for the optimal debt maturity with a fixed amount of debt to issue. The resulting model is still dynamic in that the firm optimally rebalances its capital structure with an exogenously given frequency (debt maturity) or optimally chooses its debt maturity in meeting its requirement of issuing a certain amount of debt. The results are reported in<xref ref-type="table" rid="tb3">table 3</xref>. Since the initial interest rate of 7% is close to the long‐run mean of 7.16%, the results for constant and stochastic interest rates are similar, and we will focus only on panel C and panel D. When the maturity is shorter, the default risk is smaller for a given level of debt, and thus the firm can optimally issue more debt. This results in a higher leverage ratio. However, since the default risk is quite small even at high leverage ratios when the debt maturity is short, the credit spread is quite low. When the firm is constrained to issue longer maturity debts, as expected, the credit spread widens. For example, the credit spread of the optimally issued debt increases from 8.3 basis points when debt maturity is fixed at 2 years to 46.7 basis points when debt maturity is fixed at 12 years.<table-wrap id="tb3" position="float">

            <p>Note that the optimal leverage ratio is not monotonically decreasing in debt maturity. When the debt maturity is short, the firm can afford to optimally issue more debt because the default risk is small. By contrast, if the firm is constrained to rebalance less frequently (longer debt maturity), then the gain of dynamically adjusting capital structure is small. As a result, the firm issues debt more aggressively. The reasons for issuing debt more aggressively at shorter and longer maturity are different. Neither too short nor too long maturity may be optimal because rebalancing too often increases transaction costs and because rebalancing too infrequently reduces the tax benefits.</p>
            <p>Panel D in<xref ref-type="table" rid="tb3">table 3</xref>examines a firm’s debt maturity choice given that it needs to issue a certain amount of debt. When the firm is constrained to have low leverage, the firm optimally issues longer maturity debt because the benefit of rebalancing is limited. By contrast, when the firm is constrained to issue higher amounts of debt, it optimally chooses short maturity to reduce the risk of default. Constraining the firm to too low leverage or too high leverage is not optimal for the firm value. Given the choice, the firm will optimally lever moderately.</p>

As we discussed above, a firm optimally levers more aggressively when the debt maturity is low or high. Figures<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fg2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fg4">4</xref>plot the levered firm value as a function of the leverage ratio when the debt maturity is fixed at 2, 6, and 10 years, respectively. Initially, the levered firm value increases as the leverage increases. However, after a point, the marginal benefit of leveraging becomes smaller than the marginal cost. The peak in each figure denotes the optimal levered firm value versus the optimal leverage ratio.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float">

         <title>Concluding Remarks</title>
         <p>The existing models of the optimal capital structure consider neither stochastic interest rates nor optimal maturity structure. This article develops a model of optimal capital structure and optimal maturity structure with a Vasicek (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf36">1977</xref>) interest rate process. Valuation formulas are obtained in closed form. A novel fixed‐point argument is used to obtain the total tax shield, default cost, and transactions cost for a dynamic model with potentially an infinite number of debt issues.</p>
         <p>The trade‐off between the bankruptcy costs and the tax shields of debts yields an optimal capital structure. The trade‐off between the gains from adjusting the capital structure periodically and the costs of doing so yields an optimal maturity structure. In our model the optimal capital structure and optimal maturity structure are interdependent and determined jointly.</p>
         <p>When the interest rate is a constant, the level of the interest rate affects both the optimal leverage ratio and the optimal maturity. When the interest rate follows a mean‐reverting stochastic process, the initial level as well as the long‐run mean of the interest rate process affect the pricing of both the coupon and the principal of the debt. The coupon and principal are determined in such a way that the market value of the debt (the present value of both the coupon payments and the principal) is independent of the spot interest rate level. In particular, when the interest rate is higher/lower, coupon and principal are also higher/lower, but their present values remain the same. Consequently, the optimal leverage ratio and optimal maturity are independent of the spot interest rate level.</p>
         <p>While the long‐run mean is shown to be important in determining the optimal capital structure, numerical results show that the correlation between the stochastic interest rate and the return of the firm’s asset has little impact. The leverage ratios obtained from our model are consistent in spirit with the empirical observations.</p>
         <p>The optimal maturity and the credit spread of optimally issued debt in our model appear to be small compared with observed values, indicating that factors not considered play important roles in determining them. The trade‐off between the transactions costs of issuing bonds and the gains from adjusting bonds dynamically may not be the only factor determining the optimal maturity structure. It is well known that contingent‐claim‐based structural models tend to generate credit spreads that are too small. Models that incorporate macroeconomic variables and agency conflicts seem to be able to yield credit spreads that are closer to observed values (Childs et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf6">2003</xref>; Tang and Yan<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf34">2004</xref>).</p>

Extending our model to allow for an endogenous default boundary, in the spirit of Leland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf24">1994</xref>) and Leland and Toft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf26">1996</xref>), would be an important but challenging topic for future research. In addition, Darrough and Stoughton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf8">1986</xref>) develop a capital structure model in which moral hazard and adverse selection problems exist and financing decisions affect investments. Titman and Tsyplakov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="rf35">2002</xref>) also allow a firm’s financing decisions to affect its investments. Incorporating these features would be another fruitful but difficult topic for future research.</p>
